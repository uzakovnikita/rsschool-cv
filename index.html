            <li>My goal is to become a WEB development specialist. I am always interested in learning new things and developing, especially if this area is related to technology. So far, I have only begun to study this type of activity, but every day it becomes
                more interesting, because the more clearly and vividly you see the overall picture of what is happening, the more pleasure you get from the process within which you are. While studying physics at the University, I vividly remembered the
                moment when it was a kind of accumulation of knowledge giving a common understanding of the relationship, it's really a great feeling. The feeling that you all understand, of course this is limited by the framework, but the feeling is
                still great. Similar happened in the study of JS, specifically: it was difficult to understand the circuit, thank you 21st century for the Internet and the abundance of sources of information that helped me in this difficult matter. Circuit
                I understand. I believe that most problems can be solved by hard work.</li>

                <li>Education: Education higher technical, today I study in a magistracy on a full-time Department. With the programming profession is not connected. Studied all the materials yourself using the tutorial <a href="http://learn.javascript.ru"
                        title="learn.javascript.ru" target="_blank">learn.javascript.ru</a> and video tutorials on youtube.</li>
                <li>Practice, when viewed as communication with native speakers, is virtually nonexistent. He studied English as part of the educational programs of the school and the University. I estimate my own level of language proficiency as initial.</li>
