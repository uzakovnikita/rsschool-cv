3. My goal is to become a WEB development specialist. I am always 
interested in learning new things and developing, especially if this
area is related to technology. So far, I have only begun to study 
this type of activity, but every day it becomes more interesting, 
because the more clearly and vividly you see the overall picture of 
what is happening, the more pleasure you get from the process within 
which you are. While studying physics at the University, I vividly 
remembered the moment when it was a kind of accumulation of knowledge 
giving a common understanding of the relationship, it's really a great 
feeling. The feeling that you all understand, of course this is limited 
by the framework, but the feeling is still great. Similar happened in 
the study of JS, specifically: it was difficult to understand the circuit, 
thank you 21st century for the Internet and the abundance of sources of 
information that helped me in this difficult matter. Circuit I understand. 
I believe that most problems can be solved by hard work.
4. Skills: entry level javascript
5. Code examples: 
```javascript window.onload = () => {
    elems = document.getElementsByTagName('p');
    for (let i = 0; i < elems.length; i++) {
        // console.log(elems[i].tagName);
        // console.log(elems[i].parentNode);
        // console.log(elems[i].previousSibling.nodeType);
        if (elems[i].nodeType === 1) {
            console.log('Это узел элемента');
        }
        if (elems[i].previousSibling.nodeType === 3) {
            console.log('Это текстовый узел');
        }
    }
    console.log(document.querySelector('div').children)
    console.log(document.querySelector('div').lastChild);
    console.log(document.querySelector('div').firstChild);
    console.log(document.querySelector('div').innerHTML)
} 
```
6. Experience: I have no real project experience. Can insert 
here, as a demonstration of the skills of using the editor 
link on the website. For example [this](https://yandex.ru).
7. Education: Education higher technical, today I study in a 
magistracy on a full-time Department. With the programming 
profession is not connected. Studied all the materials yourself 
using the [tutorial learn.javascript.ru](learn.javascript.ru) and 
video tutorials on youtube.
8. Practice, when viewed as communication with native speakers, 
is virtually nonexistent. He studied English as part of the 
educational programs of the school and the University. I estimate
my own level of language proficiency as initial.
